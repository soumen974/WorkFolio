A resume is a brief document summarizing your education, work history, skills, and achievements. It's used when applying for jobs or opportunities. It typically includes contact info, a career objective, education, work experience, skills, and notable accomplishments. Customize it for each application, and keep it concise, error-free, and impactful.
